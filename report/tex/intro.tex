Loyalty programs constitute a huge market in consumer retail and are a major source of revenue for many low margin businesses.
Over 48 billion dollars in perceived value of rewards is issued in the United States alone every year, with every household having over 19 loyalty memberships on an average (\cite{berry2013loyalty}).
This market constitutes credit cards, hotel and airline reward programs, and more recently even restaurants, grocery and retail stores.
Though forming a big component of the market, there is little scientific understanding about the design of loyalty reward programs. We aim to address this gap with our research.

One popular form of loyalty reward programs is \emph{frequency reward programs}, where customers earn \emph{points} as currency over spendings with merchants and are able to redeem these points into dollar valued rewards after achieving certain threshold point collections.
There is extant literature on characterizing customer behavior toward frequency reward programs.
Most of the literature is empirical in nature, and relies on psychological behavioral patterns among customers, as opposed to rational economic decision making (\cite{kivetz2006goal,dreze2004using,gao2014influence}) .
On the merchant end, many benefits of running reward programs have been argued in literature in addition to possibly increasing the market share - for instance, user attribution for firms having multiple touchpoints; increase in sales due to referrals; personalized price discrimination and product recommendations, to name a few (\cite{ryu2007penny}).
Among a few examples of popular frequency reward programs, Starbucks allows members to earn ``stars'' on purchases which can be redeemed for free coffee drinks, Bloomingdale's offers \$25 reward for every 5000 points, and Target offers a 5\% cashback on all purchases (\cite{cvs2015target}).

In this paper, we consider a competitive duopoly of two merchants where one merchant offers a frequency reward program and the other offers traditional pricing with discounts.
Though revenue management literature often deals with dynamic pricing of products, many retail merchants offering rewards often pre-commit to their prices. 
We assume that both merchants commit to their product pricing apriori and characterize a novel model of customer choice where customers measure their utilities in rational economic terms.
In addition, we investigate the direct effects on the revenue objective of the merchant and characterize the optimal reward design choice for the merchant offering the frequency reward program, based on different customer populations.
Specifically, we answer the following question: how should the merchant decide the optimal thresholds and dollar value of rewards to optimize for its revenue share from the participating customer population.
One important constraint we impose is that the merchant has to choose a \emph{one design fits all} reward program for the entire participating customer population and is not allowed to personalize the program for different customer segments.

This is how the remaining of the paper is structured. First, we will describe some related work. Then we will give an overview of our model and results and justify some of our assumptions. 
In Section~\ref{sec:model} we will describe our model in technical detail followed by the main results in Section~\ref{sec:results}. 
We will conclude with a short discussion on future work in Section~\ref{sec:conc}.
