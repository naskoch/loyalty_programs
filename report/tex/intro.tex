Loyalty programs constitute a huge market in consumer retail and are a major source of revenue for many low margin businesses.
Over 48 billion dollars in perceived value of rewards is issued in the United States alone every year, with every household having over 19 loyalty memberships on an average (\cite{berry2013loyalty}).
This market constitutes credit cards, hotel and airline reward programs, and more recently even restaurants, grocery and retail stores.
Though forming a big component of the market, there is little scientific understanding about the design of loyalty reward programs. We aim to address this gap with this research.

One popular form of loyalty reward programs is \emph{frequency reward programs}, where customers earn \emph{points} as currency over spendings with merchants and are able to redeem these points into dollar valued rewards after achieving certain threshold point collections.
There is extant literature on characterizing customer behavior toward frequency reward programs.
Most of the literature is empirical in nature, and relies on psychological behavioral patterns among customers, as opposed to rational economic decision making.
In this paper, we consider a competitive duopoly of two merchants where one merchant offers a loyalty reward program and the other offers traditional pricing with discounts and characterize a novel model of customer choice where customers measure their utilities in rational economic terms.
In addition, we characterize the optimal reward design choice for the merchant offering the frequency reward program, based on different customer populations: specifically, how should the merchant decide the optimal thresholds and dollar value of rewards to optimize for its revenue share from the participating customer population.
One important constraint we impose is that the merchant has to choose a \emph{one design fits all} reward program for the entire participating customer population and is not allowed to personalize the program for different customer segments.

This is how the remaining of the paper is structured. First we will describe some past work. Then we will go over our contributions and explain how our work builds on top of past literature. In Section~\ref{sec:model} we will describe our model followed by the main results in Section~\ref{sec:results}. We will follow up with a short discussion and future work in Section~\ref{sec:conc}.
